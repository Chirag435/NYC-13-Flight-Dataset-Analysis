Around the globe, we often see many uncertainties in flights like its cancellation, arrival time and delay, departure time, departure delay, air time, performance and its reliability. There are many factors which affect the schedule of various flights. In this project we are doing an analysis of the NYC 2013 Flight dataset. This flight data is about the flights that departed from NYC in 2013. Furthermore, we are only interested in the flights having DMV (Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia) destinations. Along with the flights dataset, there are other datasets for weather, planes, federal holidays and airlines information as well. With the help of these datasets we will carry out the flight analysis and build a predictive model to estimate the arrival delay and cancelled flights.
